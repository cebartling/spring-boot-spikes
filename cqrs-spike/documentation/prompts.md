## Implementation Plans

```
Using @documentation/features/002-feature-product-catalog.md,
create an implementation plan for AC2: Product Event Store.
Think hard about the implementation plan in detail with steps and sub-steps.
Feel free to include Mermaid.js diagrams or Markdown tables if they help clarify the plan.
Save the implementation plan in @documentation/plans/product-catalog/AC2-product-event-store.md.
```


## Executing Implementation Plans

```
Implement @documentation/plans/product-catalog/AC2-product-event-store.md.
Create a feature branch and commit small changes often to this feature branch.
All changes will reside in this feature branch until the implementation is complete.
Once the implementation is complete, create a pull request to merge the feature branch into the main branch.
The pull request should include a description of the changes made and reference the implementation plan.
```
