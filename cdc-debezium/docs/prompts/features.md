# Feature Prompts

```
Think hard about how to implement the feature specification found at @docs/features/FEATURE-001.md.
Break this feature specification into small, independently testable implementation plans.
For each implementation plan: describe changes, file names, commands to run, and acceptance criteria.
Optimize for fast feedback and local validation.
Write in markdown format.
Write files to @docs/implementation-plans directory.
Create a feature branch off of main for this work.
Commit changes with clear messages.
Once complete, create a pull request for review.
```
