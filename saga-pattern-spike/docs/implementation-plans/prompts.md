## Prompts

### Create feature


### Create implementation plans



### Execute implementation plans

#### Implement INFRA-001-infrastructure

```
Implement @docs/implementation-plans/INFRA-001-infrastructure.md.
Think hard about the implementation plan in detail with steps and sub-steps.
Create unit and integration tests as needed to verify the implementation.
Update any relevant documentation to reflect the changes made during the implementation.
Ensure that the implementation adheres to best practices and coding standards.
Relevant Cucumber-based acceptance tests should successfully execute, verifying the implementation.
Create a feature branch and commit small changes often to this feature branch.
All changes will reside in this feature branch until the implementation is complete.
Once the implementation is complete, create a pull request to merge the feature branch into the main branch.
The pull request should include a description of the changes made and reference the implementation plan.
```

#### Implement INFRA-002-accceptance-testing

```
Implement @docs/implementation-plans/INFRA-002-acceptance-testing.md.
Think hard about the implementation plan in detail with steps and sub-steps.
Update any relevant documentation to reflect the changes made during the implementation.
Ensure that the implementation adheres to best practices and coding standards.
Create a feature branch and commit small changes often to this feature branch.
All changes will reside in this feature branch until the implementation is complete.
Once the implementation is complete, create a pull request to merge the feature branch into the main branch.
The pull request should include a description of the changes made and reference the implementation plan.
